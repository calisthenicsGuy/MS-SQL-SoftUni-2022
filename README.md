Databases are the standard way of using dynamic information in modern technology, making them an indispensable part of almost every application. The intensive database fundamentals course will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - Microsoft SQL Server. The course focuses heavily on the relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Provides fundamental knowledge of working with ACID transactions and transaction processing, and practical tips for performance tuning. This course lays the foundations of working with databases,
